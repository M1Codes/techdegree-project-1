        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <h3>About Me:</h3>
        <p>
          Hello, my name is Marcus Smith. My screen name is M1. I am a
          23-year-old prospective software engineer from Los Angeles County,
          California that loves and enjoys most of everything about tech. I
          lived in Atlanta, Ga from 2016 to 2020 as an undergraduate student
          studying Philosophy at Morehouse College (Class of Spring, 2021). I’m
          ecstatic and overjoyed to begin my journey of becoming a software
          engineer as a novice coder.
        </p>
        <h3>My Learnig Style:</h3>
        <p>
          Throughout the majority of my life, I have always been an autodidact.
          Meaning, when it comes to learning, I am most comfortable learning
          independently or teaching myself how to acquire a skill. I find that
          trial and error are the most effective attributes in learning a new
          skill. They yield desired results when combined with proper reflection
          and analysis.
        </p>
