        <h2>Origin Story</h2>
        <p>
          I was born in Torrance, California in 19** on the day of <br />
          **-**. Even though I was born in Torrance I've never lived in Torrance
          a day outside of the hospital. Raised by a single mother who worked
          hard; at an early age, I learned the value of focus and hard work.<br />
          Even though my mother dropped out of high school to support her
          siblings she still managed to lead her only child through
          undergraduate studies. If were not for her sacrifices, I would be a
          negative statistic. I found an interest in computer science in middle
          school. As I was a part of the robotics club. I had always done an
          excellent job in mathematics and science except for my mediocre
          performance in biology. It was not until undergrad that I knew I would
          one day learn to code. Fast-forward, here I am as a Philosopher,
          learning how to code my first languages.
